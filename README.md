Hi, my name is Andrey, <br>
I'm 21, I live in Krasnodar (Russia) 🙋‍♂️

Graduated from 9th grade school
I have secondary-special education: <br>"Programming in computer systems " , 
but they didn 't teach anything there ,<br> so I started self - education 😅

In my free time I like to play computer and board games with my girlfriend, <br>watch videos on YouTube and Tiktok, and of course program in Python 🐍
